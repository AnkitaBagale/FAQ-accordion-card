The challenge was to build out this FAQ accordion card and get it looking as close to the design as possible. Used pure Html and Css to complete this challenge on Frontend mentor (https://www.frontendmentor.io).


Challenge had below requirements-

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
